## 📑 Game Description
*Wouldn't it be great if students who are neurodivergent could socialize with their peers while simultaneously learning to code?* 

This is the problem I wanted to solve, by leveraging a video game format to create an environment for students to create a virtual environment with virtual pets/companions that you can code custom skills into, by leveraging a video game to create a virtual pet/companion that you could code custom skills into. Students can challenge their classmates and their companions to obstacle courses of their own design, or designed by a teacher.
